          Hi my name is Nicholas Liebmann and I've been obsessed with technology
          ever since I saw the movie Spy Kids. In college I wanted to study Computer
          Science however never had the grades. When I had to declare a major I was
          told the next best alternative was a math program referred to as
          Computational Mathematics. I applied and got rejected because the Math
          department required students to have above a cumulative 2.0 GPA in Math.
          I think I had a 1.87 GPA. I've been a terrible student for as long as I can
          remember. In school I mainly got C's although had failed tons of classes. I
          failed Calc 2 four times. I got caught cheating on my very last final exam
          in college. I shouldn't have my degree however was given the choice by my
          university to either be expelled or receive my degree with the agreed upon
          phrases "Cheater" and "Academically Dishonest" plastered all over my
          Transcript.

          Taking shortcuts, cheating, and lying on my academics got me to my Spring
          semester of 2018. At this point in my life it was the 2nd semester of my
          Junior year and just beginning my upper divisions yet still not in the Math
          program. Reality began to present itself so decided that if I did not pass
          all my classes then I would drop out. Of course, nothing changed until, I
          received the lowest midterm grade of my entire life. My test score was the
          lowest in the entire class actually at a whopping 8% with the next lowest
          score being a 31%. Continuing to try and weasel by in life figured I would
          go to office hours and beg for any help that I could. At a jam packed
          office hours session got absolutely torn apart by my favorite teacher of
          all time Professor Roger Dodd. He read my like a book and within seconds
          realized how little work I had done for his class and let me have it. He
          screamed in my face for a solid 2 minutes filling me with embarrassment,
          humiliation, and disgust. In that second of silence when he was done I
          realized I had nothing to say because he was right about everything. While
          standing with my back against the wall I saw no purpose to try and conjure
          a lie or excuse as it was a time of reflection where it became clear that
          I was and had been doing nothing. I had been doing absolutely everything
          except trying so immediately left Professor Rodd's office and went straight
          to the library.

          I figured the best starting point was the textbook so rented it out and
          found myself a seat. I opened it up to page 1 and saw equations, letters,
          figures, numbers, and very few words. The decision that changed my future
          was the one I made there at the 2nd floor seat at the MLK library. The
          text looked impossible to read so figured my options were to quit and say
          adios to college or try a little by giving it my best or just figure it
          out. I spent 3 days in the library trying to read 1 full page. I wanted
          to quit an uncountable number of times however didn't want to fail even
          more. Reading the page wasn't good enough and understanding wasn't
          acceptable either because in my mind if I struggled with page 1 then
          I could only imagine what the rest of the book would be like so made my
          intention be that I had to read and understand everything on that page
          with 100% certainty. I don't really remember everything I did in my time
          at the library but I do remember the moment I finished reading page 1 and
          just how proud I was of myself.

          Learning from that point forward became addicting and my passion with the
          library becoming my training center. At the brink of COVID-19, I was just
          3 weeks into my final semester of college. I was given my Academically
          Dishonest B.S. Degree in Applied Mathematics of May 2020. My dream had
          always been tech so in June 2020 made it my personal goal to make that
          happen! I taught myself software engineering by referring back to my old
          college's BS programs, locating the SE major along with its class
          requirements, then worked my way down that list while making note of every
          course's textbook. I spent 2 years reading all 18 textbooks and then the
          next year coding to ensure comprehension and practice the craft. I never
          found a job and to be completely transparent within the 3 year time period
          never even made it past the 2nd round. I had proved myself to be a liar
          and cheater academically so wanted to at the very least prove to myself
          that these attributes about me were not true by earning a job in a field
          that I had no prior knowledge of because in such a highly competitive field
          the only way to truly earn a spot is by putting in the work.

          Of all the dumb ideas I've had in my life that was by miles the dumbest.
          Lying and cheating are what made the tech industry what it is and for those
          looking to make the initial break-in it's a dog eat dog world. I support
          the competition and taking the risks of doing what needs to be done as
          that's business it's just for me personally not what I want. I spent 4 long
          miserable years of my life trying to do literally anything I could to get a
          job and ultimately failed. The difference between this failure and my
          Linear Algebra test was that this time I had something to say which was
          that I tried my best and really believe I could've been a phenomenal
          engineer the truth is I just never got the chance which sucks... but is ok!
          I've proved to myself that I can accomplish anything and even in the face
          of failure stayed true to who I wanted to be.

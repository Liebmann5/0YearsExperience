## AutoApply

> Note: The name of the repo is Web_Scraper because I created it to learn [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) and [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) however once I learned both made a program to fill out job applications for myself and then turned out to make this my 1st huge project so kept the name as I thought it was cool how I went from nothing to something!

*AutoApply is a software that applies to jobs for any and everyone. The user downloading the repo and then running the program is meant to be the most difficult task. Once the thing gets going the user will will fill out a job application which asks for all the general information most every application asks for from candidates. The next part will be a written response where the user will explain their motivation and anything else in regards to the reason for wanting the chosen specified job. After that they'll explain what makes them fit for the specified job. The last part will walk the user through any restrictions, considerations, and constraints they have regarding the jobs the software applies to. That's it!*
